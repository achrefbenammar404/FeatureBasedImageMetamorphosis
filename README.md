## visual demonstration
![Feature Based Image Metamorphosis](Image/image.png)

This repository contains an implementation of a variation of the Feature-Based Image Metamorphosis algorithm, inspired by the paper "Feature Based Image Metamorphosis" by Thaddeus Beer and Shawn Neely (2011). The variation is designed for use with a single image and a set of coupled vectors, enabling creative and unique image transformations.

## Usage

Refer to the [How to Use Notebook](HowToUse.ipynb) for detailed instructions on applying the Feature-Based Image Metamorphosis algorithm with a single image and coupled vectors.

## Implementation Details

- `ImageMorphism.py`: Core implementation of the Feature-Based Image Metamorphosis algorithm variation.
- `Line.py`: definition of a class later needed in the algorithm
- `How_to_Use.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook providing a step-by-step guide.
